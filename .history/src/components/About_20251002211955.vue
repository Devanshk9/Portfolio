        <p class="text-2xl leading-relaxed opacity-90">
          Hi, I’m <span class="font-semibold">Devansh Khetan</span> — a builder,
          designer, and engineer who loves turning ideas into impactful
          products. I enjoy blending <span class="font-mono">code</span> with
          <span class="italic">creativity</span>, working across web apps, UI/UX
          design, and algorithmic problem solving.
        </p>
        <p class="text-2xl leading-relaxed opacity-90">
          Currently, I’m building <span class="font-semibold">NoteGo</span>, an
          academic resource platform with thousands of students, experimenting
          with IoT projects, and sharpening my competitive programming skills
          for ICPC. I’ve also been a
          <span class="font-semibold">Google Code-in Finalist</span> and
          continue exploring how technology can empower communities.
        </p>
        <p class="text-2xl leading-relaxed opacity-90">
          Outside of code, you’ll often find me with a piano, guitar, or
          notebook — creating stories, music, or sketches. I believe in learning
          by doing and enjoy building things that make people’s lives simpler
          and smarter.
        </p>
